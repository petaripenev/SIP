Below are a list of terms and variables used throughout the `qSIP2` that will retain a specific meaning and will remain unchanged (without adequate notice).

# Terminology

- `source_mat_id`: Unique name for the experimental source material prior to DNA extraction, etc
  - The `source_mat_id` is also used as the link between sample metadata and source metadata
  - This term is derived from the MISIP standards. Previous synonyms in qSIP include "rep" and "tube"
- `isotope`: The isotope used
  - For qSIP, the choices are limited to one of 12C, 13C, 14N, 15N, 16O or 18O
  - This term is also a required MISIP field
- `isotopolog`: The name or ID of the labeled substrate
  - This term is also a required MISIP field
  - For qSIP it doesn't have to strictly adhere to MISIP standards, and a string such as "glucose" will suffice
